Here, we utilize the ribose-seq technique to capture embedded rNMPs in mtDNA of six different human cell types with wild-type or mutant ribonuclease (RNase) H2 genotype. The rNMPs are preferentially embedded in the DNA of the light strand in most cell types studied, but not in the liver-tissue cells, in which the rNMPs are dominant on the heavy strand of hmtDNA. We uncover common rNMP hotspots and conserved rNMP-enriched zones across the entire hmtDNA, including in the replication-control region, which may result in the suppression of mtDNA replication. We also show that longer coding sequences have a significantly higher rNMP-embedment frequency per nucleotide. While the composition of the embedded rNMPs varies among the different cell types, by studying the genomic context of embedded rNMPs, we detected common rNMP-embedment patterns in hmtDNA.

Human cells employ at least three DSB repair mechanisms, with a preference for non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) over homologous recombination (HR) and microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ)1,2. In contrast to HR, NHEJ and MMEJ do not utilize a DNA template molecule to recover damaged and/or lost nucleotides2. NHEJ directly ligates broken DNA ends, while MMEJ exploits the alignment of short microhomologies on the DSB sides and is associated with deletions of the sequence between the microhomologies3,4. It is unknown whether and to what extent a transcript RNA has a direct role in DSB-repair mechanisms in mammalian cells. Here, we show that both coding and non-coding transcript RNA facilitates DSB repair in a sequence-specific manner in human cells. Depending on its sequence complementarity with the broken DNA ends, the transcript RNA could promote the repair of a DSB or gap in its DNA gene via NHEJ or MMEJ, or mediate RNA-templated repair. The transcript RNA influences DSB repair by NHEJ and MMEJ even when the transcription level is low.

The ribose-seq technique is one of a few techniques designed to capture and map rNMPs embedded in genomic DNA. The first step of ribose-seq is restriction enzyme (RE) fragmentation, which cuts the genome into smaller fragments for subsequent rNMP capture. The RE selection chosen for genomic DNA fragmentation in the first step of the rNMP-capture techniques determines the genomic regions in which the rNMPs can be captured. Here, we designed a computational method, Restriction Enzyme Set and Combination Optimization Tools (RESCOT), to calculate the genomic coverage of rNMP-captured regions for a given RE set and to optimize the RE set to significantly increase the rNMP-captured-region coverage. Analyses of ribose-seq libraries for which the RESCOT tools were applied reveal that many rNMPs were captured in the expected genomic regions. Since different rNMP-mapping techniques utilize RE fragmentation and purification steps based on size-selection of the DNA fragments in the protocol, we discuss the possible usage of RESCOT for other rNMP-mapping techniques. In summary, RESCOT generates optimized RE sets for the fragmentation step of many rNMP capture techniques to maximize rNMP capture rate and thus enable researchers to better study characteristics of rNMP incorporation.","tags":["Next generation sequencing","Optimization","Restriction enzyme","Ribonucleotides in DNA","rNMP capture techniques","rNMP incorporation","ribose-seq"],"title":"RESCOT: Restriction enzyme set and combination optimization tools for rNMP capture techniques","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1590507900,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590507900,"objectID":"485ac5274516492dad7e58cc03f2baaf","permalink":"http://penghao.best/talk/rna2020-25th-annual-meeting-of-rna-society/","publishdate":"2020-05-18T22:06:56-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/rna2020-25th-annual-meeting-of-rna-society/","section":"event","summary":"Ribonucleotide incorporation characteristics around the yeast autonomously replicating sequences reveal the labor division of replicative DNA polymerases","tags":[],"title":"RNA2020, 25th annual meeting of RNA Society","type":"event"},{"authors":["Sathya Balachander","Alli L Gombolay","Taehwan Yang","Penghao Xu","Gary Newnam","Havva Keskin","Waleed M.

Here, by using ribose-seq and Ribose-Map techniques, we built and analyzed high-throughput sequencing libraries of rNMPs derived from mitochondrial and nuclear DNA of budding and fission yeast. We reveal both common and unique features of rNMP sites among yeast species and strains, and between wild type and different ribonuclease H-mutant genotypes. We demonstrate that the rNMPs are not randomly incorporated in DNA. We highlight signatures and patterns of rNMPs, including sites within trinucleotide-repeat tracts. Our results uncover that the deoxyribonucleotide immediately upstream of the rNMPs has a strong influence on rNMP distribution, suggesting a mechanism of rNMP accommodation by DNA polymerases as a driving force of rNMP incorporation. Consistently, we find deoxyadenosine upstream from the most abundant genomic rCMPs and rGMPs. This study establishes a framework to better understand mechanisms of rNMP incorporation in DNA.","tags":[],"title":"Ribonucleotide incorporation in yeast genomic DNA shows preference for cytosine and guanosine preceded by deoxyadenosine","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let‚Äôs make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?

To determine the association of such genetic variation with rice farming changes is critical for understanding the adaptive evolution of weedy rice. We studied weedy-rice specific novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by genome-wide comparison between DNA sequences of weedy and cultivated rice, in addition to polymerase chain reaction fingerprinting at 22 selected novel SNP loci in weedy rice populations. A great number of novel SNPs were identified across the weedy rice genome. High frequencies of the novel SNPs were determined at the 22 selected loci, although with considerable variation among weedy rice populations in different rice-planting regions. The highest frequency (‚àº57%) of novel SNPs was identified in weedy rice populations from Jiangsu that experienced the most dramatic changes in rice farming styles, including the shift from transplanting to direct seeding, and from indica to japonica varieties. The lowest frequency (‚àº29%) was detected in weedy rice populations from Northeast China, where rice farming has undergone relatively less change. The association between frequencies of novel SNPs in weedy rice populations and the extent of changes in rice farming styles suggests the critical role of adaptive mutation and accumulation of the mutation influenced by human activities in the rapid evolution of weedy rice.","tags":["adaptive evolution","change of farming practice","genome sequence","human influence","novel mutant","weed"],"title":"Increased novel single nucleotide polymorphisms in weedy rice populations associated with the change of farming styles: Implications in adaptive mutation and evolution","type":"publication"}]
