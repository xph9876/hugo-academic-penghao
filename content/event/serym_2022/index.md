summary: "Frequency and position of ribonucleotide incorporation reveal the division of labor of replicative DNA polymerases"
abstract: "Ribonucleotide (rNMP) incorporation in DNA generally occurs in all kingdoms of life, results in DNA structural change, genome instability, and influences the protein-DNA interaction. Previous studies in yeast showed that replicative DNA polymerases α, δ, and ε, particularly low-fidelity mutants of these Pols misincorporate substantial rNMPs in DNA during DNA replication. These rNMPs are efficiently removed with the help of ribonuclease (RNase) H2. In this study, we performed a computational analysis of rNMPs embedded around yeast autonomously replicating sequences (ARSs), where DNA replication starts, and Pols α, δ, and ε synthesize the leading and lagging strands. We used published rNMP incorporation datasets generated by ribose-seq, emRiboSeq, and RHII-HydEn-seq techniques. We analyzed the rNMP incorporation strand biases in both wild-type and ribonuclease (RNase) H2-nulllibraries. The results show an overall preference of rNMP incorporation on the leading strand in wild-type Pols and Pol ε low-fidelity mutant libraries. But Pol α or Pol δ low-fidelity mutant libraries display a preference for rNMP incorporation on the lagging strand. All the rNMP preferences are reduced around late-firing and low-efficiency ARSs in RNase H2-mutant libraries. Furthermore, at the beginning of DNA replication, the leading/lagging-strand ratio of rNMP incorporation increases in wild-type DNA Pol and Pol ε low-fidelity mutant libraries and decreases in Pol δ low-fidelity mutant libraries, which reflects the Pol δ-Pol ε handoff and validates replicative polymerase division of labor in the leading strand synthesis. Moreover, we found the different rNMP incorporation context preferences of different DNA polymerases. The DNA Pol δ prefers to incorporate rNMPs after dCMP while Pol ε prefers to incorporate rNMPs after dCMP. Those preferences are strengthened with low-fidelity mutants. Overall, we uncover the characteristics of rNMP incorporation around ARS’s, which are induced by different DNA polymerases, and we validate the labor division of DNA polymerases.
