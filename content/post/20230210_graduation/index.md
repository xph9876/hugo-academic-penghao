It is with great pride and appreciation that I announce the completion of my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics at Georgia Tech, with a thesis entitled "*Revealing patterns of ribonucleotide incorporation in genomic DNA of eukaryotic cells*". Throughout my five-year journey, I was fortunate enough to receive invaluable guidance from my advisor, **Dr. Francesca Storici**, and unwavering support from my committee members: **Dr. Mark Borodovsky**, **Dr. Shamkant Navathe**, **Dr. Patrick McGrath**, and **Dr. Fredrik Vannberg**. I am excited to continue my research in Storici Lab as a postdoc, with a particular focus on investigating rNMP incorporation in DNA.
