I am glad to announce that I was awarded the [Keystone Symposia Future of Science Fund scholarship](https://www.keystonesymposia.org/financial-aid/scholarships) from the conference __Keystone Symposia X1: Genomic Instability and DNA repair__. At the upcoming conference, I will be presenting new findings on the characteristics of rNMP incorporation in human mtDNA. Welcome to view my poster (and attend my potential talk) in Whistler, BC, Canada on Mar 19-23! Please feel free to stop by and discuss my research with me!
