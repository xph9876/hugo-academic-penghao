I received the [Keystone Symposia Future of Science Fund scholarship](https://www.keystonesymposia.org/financial-aid/scholarships) from the conference __Keystone Symposia X1: Genomic Instability and DNA repair__. I'll show our new results about rNMP incorporation characteristics in human mtDNA at this conference. Welcome to check my poster (and potential talk) in Whistler, BC, Canada on Mar 19-23!
