abstract: Double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA are challenging lesions to repair. Human
  cells employ at least three DSB repair mechanisms, with a preference for non-homologous
  end joining (NHEJ) over homologous recombination (HR) and microhomology-mediated
  end joining (MMEJ)1,2. In contrast to HR, NHEJ and MMEJ do not utilize a DNA template
  molecule to recover damaged and/or lost nucleotides2. NHEJ directly ligates broken
  DNA ends, while MMEJ exploits the alignment of short microhomologies on the DSB
  sides and is associated with deletions of the sequence between the microhomologies3,4.
  It is unknown whether and to what extent a transcript RNA has a direct role in DSB-repair
  mechanisms in mammalian cells. Here, we show that both coding and non-coding transcript
  RNA facilitates DSB repair in a sequence-specific manner in human cells. Depending
  on its sequence complementarity with the broken DNA ends, the transcript RNA could
  promote the repair of a DSB or gap in its DNA gene via NHEJ or MMEJ, or mediate
  RNA-templated repair. The transcript RNA influences DSB repair by NHEJ and MMEJ
  even when the transcription level is low. The results demonstrate an unexpected
  role of transcript RNA in directing the way DSBs are repaired in human cells and
  maintaining genome stability.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared
  no competing interest.
