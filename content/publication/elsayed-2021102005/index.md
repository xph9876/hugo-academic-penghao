abstract: Summary Ribonucleoside monophosphates (rNMPs) represent the most common
  non-standard nucleotides found in the genome of cells. The distribution of rNMPs
  in DNA has been studied only in limited genomes. Using the ribose-seq protocol and
  the Ribose-Map bioinformatics toolkit, we reveal the distribution of rNMPs incorporated
  into the whole genome of a photosynthetic unicellular green alga, Chlamydomonas
  reinhardtii. We discovered a disproportionate incorporation of adenosine in the
  mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA, in contrast to the nuclear DNA, relative to the
  corresponding nucleotide content of these C. reinhardtii organelle genomes. Our
  results demonstrate that the rNMP content in the DNA of the algal organelles reflects
  an elevated ATP level present in the algal cells. We reveal specific biases and
  patterns in rNMP distributions in the algal mitochondrial, chloroplast, and nuclear
  DNA. Moreover, we identified the C. reinhardtii orthologous genes for all three
  subunits of the RNase H2 enzyme using GeneMark-EP + gene finder.
