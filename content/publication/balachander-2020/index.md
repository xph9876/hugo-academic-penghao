abstract: Despite the abundance of ribonucleoside monophosphates (rNMPs) in DNA, sites
  of rNMP incorporation remain poorly characterized. Here, by using ribose-seq and
  Ribose-Map techniques, we built and analyzed high-throughput sequencing libraries
  of rNMPs derived from mitochondrial and nuclear DNA of budding and fission yeast.
  We reveal both common and unique features of rNMP sites among yeast species and
  strains, and between wild type and different ribonuclease H-mutant genotypes. We
  demonstrate that the rNMPs are not randomly incorporated in DNA. We highlight signatures
  and patterns of rNMPs, including sites within trinucleotide-repeat tracts. Our results
  uncover that the deoxyribonucleotide immediately upstream of the rNMPs has a strong
  influence on rNMP distribution, suggesting a mechanism of rNMP accommodation by
  DNA polymerases as a driving force of rNMP incorporation. Consistently, we find
  deoxyadenosine upstream from the most abundant genomic rCMPs and rGMPs. This study
  establishes a framework to better understand mechanisms of rNMP incorporation in
  DNA.
