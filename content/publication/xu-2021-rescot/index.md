abstract: The incorporation of ribonucleoside monophosphates (rNMPs) in genomic DNA
  is a frequent phenomenon in many species, often associated with genome instability
  and disease. The ribose-seq technique is one of a few techniques designed to capture
  and map rNMPs embedded in genomic DNA. The first step of ribose-seq is restriction
  enzyme (RE) fragmentation, which cuts the genome into smaller fragments for subsequent
  rNMP capture. The RE selection chosen for genomic DNA fragmentation in the first
  step of the rNMP-capture techniques determines the genomic regions in which the
  rNMPs can be captured. Here, we designed a computational method, Restriction Enzyme
  Set and Combination Optimization Tools (RESCOT), to calculate the genomic coverage
  of rNMP-captured regions for a given RE set and to optimize the RE set to significantly
  increase the rNMP-captured-region coverage. Analyses of ribose-seq libraries for
  which the RESCOT tools were applied reveal that many rNMPs were captured in the
  expected genomic regions. Since different rNMP-mapping techniques utilize RE fragmentation
  and purification steps based on size-selection of the DNA fragments in the protocol,
  we discuss the possible usage of RESCOT for other rNMP-mapping techniques. In summary,
  RESCOT generates optimized RE sets for the fragmentation step of many rNMP capture
  techniques to maximize rNMP capture rate and thus enable researchers to better study
  characteristics of rNMP incorporation.
