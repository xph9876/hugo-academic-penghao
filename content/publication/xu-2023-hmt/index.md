abstract: Abundant ribonucleoside triphosphate (rNTP) incorporation in DNA by DNA
  polymerases in the form of ribonucleoside monophosphates (rNMPs) is a widespread
  phenomenon in nature, resulting in DNA structural change and genome instability.
  The rNMP distribution, characteristics, hotspots, and association with DNA metabolic
  processes in human mitochondrial DNA (hmtDNA) remain mostly unknown. Here, we utilize
  the ribose-seq technique to capture embedded rNMPs in mtDNA of six different human
  cell types with wild-type or mutant ribonuclease (RNase) H2 genotype. The rNMPs
  are preferentially embedded in the DNA of the light strand in most cell types studied,
  but not in the liver-tissue cells, in which the rNMPs are dominant on the heavy
  strand of hmtDNA. We uncover common rNMP hotspots and conserved rNMP-enriched zones
  across the entire hmtDNA, including in the replication-control region, which may
  result in the suppression of mtDNA replication. We also show that longer coding
  sequences have a significantly higher rNMP-embedment frequency per nucleotide. While
  the composition of the embedded rNMPs varies among the different cell types, by
  studying the genomic context of embedded rNMPs, we detected common rNMP-embedment
  patterns in hmtDNA. The genomic contexts of rNMPs found in hmtDNA are mainly distinct
  from those found in yeast mtDNA, highlighting a unique signature of rNTP incorporation
  by hmtDNA polymerase Î³.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no
  competing interest.
