abstract: Ribonucleotide triphosphate (rNTP) incorporation in DNA is a general phenomenon
  in many species. The rNTPs are misincorporated by DNA polymerases and become embedded
  ribonucleotide monophosphates (rNMPs) in DNA. Revealing patterns and preferences
  of embedded rNMPs is an important topic in the field of genome stability and DNA
  biology. Hence, we developed the RibosePreferenceAnalysis software to identify rNTP
  incorporation preferences and study the genomic contexts of the embedded rNMPs.
  This software is an easy-to-use tool for researchers who are interested in embedded
  rNMP data and provides useful results to study rNTP incorporation, embedded rNMP
  removal, and rNMP functionality.
