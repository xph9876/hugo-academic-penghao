abstract: Ribonucleoside triphosphate (rNTP) incorporation in DNA by DNA polymerases
  is a frequent phenomenon that results in DNA structural change and genome instability.
  However, it is unclear whether the rNTP incorporation into DNA follows any specific
  sequence patterns. We analyzed multiple datasets of ribonucleoside monophosphates
  (rNMPs) embedded in DNA, generated from three rNMP-sequencing techniques. These
  rNMP libraries were obtained from Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells expressing wild-type
  or mutant replicative DNA polymerase and ribonuclease H2 genes. We performed computational
  analyses of rNMP sites around early and late-firing autonomously replicating sequences
  (ARSs) of the yeast genome, where leading and lagging DNA synthesis starts bidirectionally.
  We found the preference of rNTP incorporation on the leading strand in wild-type
  DNA polymerase yeast cells. The leading/lagging-strand ratio of rNTP incorporation
  changes dramatically within the first 1,000 nucleotides from ARSs, highlighting
  the Pol δ - Pol ϵ handoff during early leading-strand synthesis. Furthermore, the
  pattern of rNTP incorporation is markedly distinct between the leading and lagging
  strands not only in mutant but also in wild-type polymerase cells. Such specific
  signatures of Pol δ and Pol ϵ provide a new approach to track the labor of these
  polymerases.
