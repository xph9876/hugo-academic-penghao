### Description

Ribonucleoside triphosphates (rNTPs) are incorporated into DNA by DNA polymerases in the form of ribonucleoside monophosphates (rNMPs), which are the most abundant non-standard nucleotides in genomic DNA in many species. The presence of rNMPs in DNA leads to DNA structural change, genome instability, and affects protein-DNA interactions.  The rNMP incorporation is also associated with a bunch of human disease including Aicardi-Gouti√®res Syndrome and various type of cancers. The incorporated rNTPs are mainly removed by the ribonucleotide excision repair (RER) pathway initiated by Ribonuclease (RNase) H2. Previous researchers already developed several rNMP-mapping techniques to capture the rNMPs in DNA at single nucleotide level. However, the analyses of rNTP incorporation are still limited to the basic study of rNMP counts and compositions in small genomes of RNase H2-deactivated cells. In this study, we aim to identify preferred rNTP-incorporation patterns, signatures, and hotspot motifs in the full genome of many eukaryotic cells including budding and fission yeast, green algae, and human cells. We hope our study can reveal the association between rNMP incorporation and vital biological processes including replication and transcription, and figure out the cellular function of rNMP incorporation.
